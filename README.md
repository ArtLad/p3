Ce dépôt contient une mini-application pour le P3 du parcours **Grande École du Numérique**.

Contact Info: art.laplace@gmail.com

This application uses deprecated libraries, be careful about your versionning!

In order to build the project your must:
- make sure that your version of Android Studio is up-to-date.
- make sure that you are using the latest version of butterknife and Espresso (deprecated).
- Download the .zip from here or do a git pull to your local branch.
- Load the files into a new project and check for versionning errors or missing dependencies.
- Build the project using the "Make Project" button on the top right hand toolbar (or use Ctr + F9) and troubleshoot from there.
- Create your emulator in the AVD manager using a level 21 API and running x86 Android 5.0.
- You should be able to now launch the application using the "Run" button on the same top right hand toolbar (or use Alt + F10).

If you have any issues building the application it maybe because of a versionning issue.

Make also sure to not have any other instances of emulators running at Run as it can prevent gradle from completing it's build process.


If you have any other issues or suggestions, feel free to contact me at the provided email.
